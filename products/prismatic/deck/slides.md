# Prismatic

### Find users of vibe coding projects through AI chats

# The Problem

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6 mt-6 text-sm">

<div>

**Broken Product Discovery**

- Users no longer search Google first.
- They ask **LLMs**: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok, DeepSeek.
- LLMs answer with a few synthesized recommendations.

*Result: most indie products are invisible in this flow.*

</div>

<div>

**Why This Is New**

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) assumed:

- Users type keywords
- Search engines crawl sites
- Ranking determines discovery

GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) reality:

- Users ask questions
- LLMs retrieve trusted sources
- Discovery happens inside **answers**

*Result: if you're not retrievable, you don't exist.*

</div>

<div>

**The Indie Developer Gap**

Bob builds an interesting product, but he:

* Is a vibe coder with little CS background
* Has no SEO / GEO expertise
* Can't negotiate with AI platforms
* Can't become his own neutral authority

*Result: Bob's product never gets mentioned.*

# Introducing Prismatic

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6 mt-6 text-sm">

<div>

**Prismatic does**:

- Ingest product websites
- Synthesize **neutral, structured descriptions**
- Publishe AI-native product pages
- Organize products by **use case**, not keywords

</div>

<div>

**New Discovery Loop**

1. Alice asks an LLM a question
2. LLM retrieves trusted sources
3. Prismatic is cited
4. Alice clicks Prismatic
5. Alice clicks the product

</div>

<div>

**Prismatic does NOT:**

* Retrain LLMs
* Upload data into LLM
* Guarantee citation in answers

</div>

# Solving the Self-Referential Paradox

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6 mt-6 text-sm">

<div>

**The Paradox**

Prismatic helps indie products get discovered by LLMs.

But Prismatic is also an indie site.

*Why would LLMs discover Prismatic?*

</div>

<div>

**The Insight**

LLM retrieval doesn't require scale or authority. It requires:

* **Clarity** — Is the answer easy to extract?
* **Structure** — Is the content well-organized?
* **Neutrality** — Is the source unbiased?
* **Answerability** — Does it directly answer the query?

</div>

<div>

**The Solution**

**LLM-Native Format** — LLM queries consume tokens. Bob's site is built for human eyes: images and JavaScript. Prismatic is built for AI: markdown and JSON, token-efficient, the **cheapest path** to an answer.

**Aggregator's Advantage** — One directory with 500 products has more credibility than 500 individual product sites. Prismatic accumulates **data gravity** and **vertical neutrality** no single indie site can match.

**Synthetic Supply** — Prismatic pre-indexes 500+ products via crawling—no approval from Bob required.

# Why Prismatic

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6 mt-6 text-sm">

<div>

**Why It's Needed**

SEO tools:
- advise
- audit
- analyze

but they are not in the discovery loop.

*Prismatic is part of the loop.*

</div>

<div>

**Who It's For**

* Vibe coders
* Indie developers
* Solo founders
* Small teams

*Anyone building outside big marketing budgets.*

</div>

<div>

**The Moat**

Prismatic compounds via:

* Structured product knowledge graph
* AI-friendly content patterns
* Retrieval-first architecture
* Neutral third-party positioning


*This is infrastructure, not consulting.*

</div>

# Business & Vision

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6 mt-6 text-sm">

<div>

**Early Business Model**

* Freemium listing
* Pay for increased visibility
* Pay for attribution & insights

</div>

<div>

**Long-Term Vision**

As AI agents grow:

* Agents will need product registries
* Discovery becomes machine-to-machine
* Structured data wins

Prismatic becomes *the product layer AI systems trust*.

</div>

<div>

**Why Now**

* AI search is becoming mainstream
* SEO mental models are breaking
* No dominant GEO standard yet

This window closes quickly.
